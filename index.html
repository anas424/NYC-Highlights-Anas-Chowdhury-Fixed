    <h2 style="margin-top : 0px; padding-top : 50px; font-size: 30px; margin-bottom: 18px;">Empire State Building</h2>
    <p class="empire-paragraph"> The site of the Empire State Building, located in Midtown South on the west side of Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets,
      was originally part of an early 18th-century farm.
      It was developed in 1893 as the site of the Waldorf–Astoria Hotel. In 1929, Empire State Inc.
      acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building.
      Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931. Despite favorable publicity related to the building's construction, because of the Great Depression and World War II,
      its owners did not make a profit until the early 1950s. </p>

    <p class="wroldtrade-paragraph"> The building's architect is David Childs,
       whose firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) also designed the Burj Khalifa and the Willis Tower.
       The construction of below-ground utility relocations, footings,
       and foundations for the new building began on April 27, 2006.
       One World Trade Center became the tallest structure in New York City on April 30,
       2012, when it surpassed the height of the Empire State Building.  </p>

  <p class="skyline-paragraph"> Skyscrapers of New York City. New York City is defined by
    its skyline—the silhouette created by Manhattan's buildings is instantly recognizable and utterly mesmerizing.
     In fact, NYC is home to more than 200 buildings
     measuring 500 feet or taller, roughly double that of its closest US competitor. </p>
